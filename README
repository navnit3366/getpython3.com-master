to build:

mkvirtualenv getpython3
pip install blogofile
cd site
blogofile build
open _site/index.html

If you install fabric, you can run:
  fab build_site

Working with the styles:
install lessc (on ubuntu: apt-get install npm, then npm install less)

cd site
./build-styles.bash

Alternatively, you can seek out your own less compiler. See the build-styles.bash script for which less file to compile to where.

During development, it may be easier to use less.js which will compile the less styles into css per-page-view. To do this, see the comments in head.mako (basically uncomment 2 lines, and comment another -- don't forget to switch back before deploying to prod).
